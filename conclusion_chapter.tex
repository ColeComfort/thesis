In this thesis, we have given nondeterministic semantics for two classes of quantum circuits.  


First, we gave a presentation $\ZXA$ for the  class of qubit circuits generated by the Toffoli gate, the not gate as well as the states $|0\rangle, \sqrt 2 |+\rangle$ and effects $\langle 0 |, \langle +|\sqrt{2}$.  We showed that this is isomorphic to the full subcategory of spans of finite sets (or equivalently matrices over the natural numbers) where the objects are powers of the 2 element set.  We also imposed a quotient to give a presentation for the full subcategory of relations of finite sets (or equivalently matrices over the Boolean semiring) where the objects are powers of the 2 element set.  In order to prove this, we gave a simpler characterisation of the Cartesian completion of a discrete inverse category: which is one half of the equivalence between partially reversible and partial computing with copying.  We restated this construction in terms of freely adding units to the diagonal maps; and showed how this can be related to the construction of stochastic systems from quantum systems.  We analyse the interaction of all of these generators and show how larger and larger fragments of $\ZXA$ can be constructed incrementally using pushouts and distributive laws; revealing the different nondeterministic/partial structures which occur along the way.


Secondly, we investigated the structure of stabilizer circuits; and showed how quopit stabilizer circuits are isomorphic to the prop of affine coisotropic relations over $\F_p$.  To perform this, we investigated the structure of the props of (affine) (co)isotropic and Lagrangian relations using graphical linear/affine algebra and the tools of categorical quantum mechanics.  We gave generators for the each of these props and showed how over prime fields, Lagrangian relations can be presented as the CPM construction applied to linear relations with respect to the orthogonal complement.  We show that doubling the prop of (affine) Lagrangian relations again with respect to the symplectic generalization of complex conjugation, given any base field, yields the prop of (affine) coisotropic relations.  We showed how by splitting the idempotents for the decoherence maps of the $Z$ or $X$-bases in this setting we obtain a multisorted prop where the state preparation and measurement maps have nice relational interpretations.  We show how this gives a graphical semantics for mixed stabilizer circuits which are broadly used for quantum error correction.  Also we relate this semantics of mixed stabilizer circuits to relational categorical semantics for electrical circuits.

In both of these two examples, these props are not only monoidal categories, but there are 2-cells between the maps themselves specifying when circuits with constrained behaviour can be coherently transformed into less constrained circuits.

In this thesis, we also attempt to give a high level categorical account of proof nets for monoidal categories; the scalable ZX-calculus being one such example.  Given a monoidal category, we first  regarded it as a monoidal lax normal functor into $\Prof$ (itself a categorification of sets and relations). This regards monoidal categories as certain lax Frobenius algebras in $\Prof$. We use the B\'enabou-Grothendieck construction to obtain a strict monoidal category which is very close to the strictification of of a monoidal category in \cite{wilson}.  
There are several threads in this thesis which are still open.

First, is to generalize $\ZXA$ to qudits; providing semantics for other full subcategories of spans and relations of finite sets/matrices over the natural numbers and Booleans.  Of course by splitting idempotents we would obtain presentations for matrices over the naturals and Booleans; however, the structure would be encoded in bits.  The question is to find satisfying well-structured presentations of these categories, not an encoding of base $n$ arithemetic in base $2$.  Doing so would potentially be the first step in proving completeness for qudit fragments of the ZH-calculus.  I hinted at a potential way to solve this by computing Gr\"obner bases string-diagrammatically.  

This way of viewing the natural-number fragments of the ZH-calculus hints at the span/relational semantics of non-prime dimensional stabilizer fragments of the  ZX-calculus.  When we presented stabilizer circuits in terms of affine Lagrangian relations, we required that the dimension be prime (or odd prime when we wanted to express phase-gates and Fourier transforms).  The requirement that the dimension be prime is needed in order for the categories of matrices and its possibly empty affine counterpart to be regular categories.  Indeed,  when a ring is not a principal ideal domain, it is not clear if these categories are even finitely complete.  However, just as in the qubit case $\ZXA$ is the full subcategory of spans of finite sets/matrices over the natural whose objects are powers of 2; one could do the same for qudits for any $d$.  This begs the question: what are the {\em linear} and {\em affine} full subcategories of matrices over the naturals and Booleans where the objects are powers of some natural number $d$.  There are both covariant and contravariant monoidal embeddings of $(\Aff\Mat_{\Z/d\Z},\oplus)$ / $(\Mat_{\Z/d\Z},\oplus)$ into $(\Mat_\N,\otimes)$ / $(\Mat_\B,\otimes)$.  What are presentations for the pushout of these two embeddings?  Does this give any insight in how to construct something close to linear/affine spans/relations over arbitrary rings?

We also did not give a completely satisfying investigation into the connection between the two-sided (co)unital completion of the inverse products of a discrete inverse category and Cartesian bicategories (of the span-variety, not of relations).  In general, it is natural to ask: when one takes the subcategory of partial isomorphisms of a Cartesian bicategory, when will the original Cartesian bicategory be recovered by adding units and counits to the inverse products.  It is enough to impose that the unit and counits be adjoint to each other, or will information about the original Cartesian bicategory be lost?


In terms of stabilizer circuits there are also many unanswered questions.  First, the most obvious is the lack of undoubled presentation for the prop of affine coisotropic relations.  This will not be too hard to do, given the recent developments on presenting quopit stabilizer circuits, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:conclagrel}.  This is a very important thing to work out, because of the close connection to Gaussian quantum mechanics.  This would likely lead to ZX-calculi for continuous variable quantum mechanics.  Even outside of the realm of quantum mechanics, giving  a relational semantics thereof will possibly shed more light on the connection between Gaussian probability and nondeterminism as in the work of \cite{stein}.


It would also be really interesting to augment our two coloured semantics for stabilizer circuits and affine classical processing with stronger classical processing.  If the relational semantics for $p$-mode nonlinear classical nondeterministic circuits were combined with quopit stabilizer circuits, this would provide a very interesting millieu between stabilizer quantum mechanics and full mixed quantum theory.  That is to say, the fragment where the scientist in the lab has access to stabilizer quantum operations, Z and X measurements, state preparations and phase-corrections; but with nonlinear classical nondeterministic post-processing.  Generally, the classical and quantum systems are put on different footings; so to the knowledge of the author the structure of this intermediate class of quantum circuits has not even been noticed, let alone explored.

Also in our categorical analysis of stabilizer codes, we have not given a graphical/categorical account of code distance, which of great practical importance in quantum error correction. 

Finally, we have made some steps into giving high-level categorical semantics for proof nets for monoidal categories/the scalable ZX-calculus.  The goal of this work was to attempt to find ways to glue different monoidal categories together so that one can work with string diagrams for multiple monoidal categories within the same setting.  This would be interesting not only from a quantum perspective, but from the broader perspective of a computer scientists who uses string diagrams as a tool for their work.  Although this work is far from finished, we hope that in the future it could lead to the development of more rich graphical calculi where the interfaces between two different systems, regarded as monoidal functors between monoidal categories can induce presentations for richer monoidal categories.
