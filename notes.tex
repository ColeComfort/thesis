%Give examples of error correcting codes and protocols with affine and non-affine classical processing
%Talk about ZX& calculus as being stabilized by nonlinear set of X operators.
%Change words white and grey to inline tikz circles
%Give interpretation of impedence calculus.  Talk about apparent relation to CP* construction.  Talk about how the ground is not the quantum discard!


%Talk about why distributive laws over partial isomorphisms dont really need to be up to zig zags
%Talk about a more general construction

%cite carboni and walters paper on laxity and adjointness
%check that interpretation of phase shift gate is compatible with the symplectic one
%check interpretations of electrical circuits in ZX notation
