\chapter{Introduction}


Nonlocality of quantum mechanics. Some fragments of quantum mechanics do have local hidden variable models.  We exhibit such models for two fragment. The first such fragment is that generated by the Toffoli gate as well as state preparation and post selection in the $Z$ and $X$ basis.  The second fragment is odd prime qudit dimensional stabilizer circuits.  The first fragment is a full subcategory of matrices under the natural numbers.  This is equivalent to a full subcategory of spans of finite sets.
Stabilizer circuits are projectively equivalent to a subcategory of relations between matrices over finite fields.

There is a conceptual advantage to modelling these fragments in terms of categories of spans or relations:  this perspective illuminates some of the most elegant symmetries of the ZX and ZH.

For example, \dag-Frobenius algebras in $\FHilb$, which are used to express orthonormal bases are shown to arise from a colimit in such a fragment.  Moreover, the Euler decomposition of the Fourier transform is shown to arise from the hopf law.

The CPM construction, which is traditionally used to model density matrices using monoidal categories, also surprisingly plays various roles in our presentations of these fragments of quantum circuits.  Not only does it allow one to mix, quantum circuits, a very closely related construction adds the plus state to partial, reversible boolean circuits.  Perhaps more surprisingly, the CPM construction also captures the notion of the Fourier transform, and Euler decomposition; when it is applied to phase-free circuits: ie, circuits which correspond to linear subspaces of $\F_p$-vector spaces.

Finally, we conclude the thesis by regarding {\em quantum protocols themselves} as a generalized category of relations.  The machinery involved in this case is the 2-category of profunctors: which can be thought of as bimodules of categories.  This gives a structural account of the scalable ZX-calculus, which is used to parametrize families of circuits using string diagrams.  In particular, this is a limit over profunctors: an instance of the so called Benabou-Grothendieck construction.  Because of the generality at which this is proven, we suggest applications in other domains where string diagrams are used.
