\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}


Quantum computing is traditionally though of in terms of the category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where measurements are probabilistic processes, according to the Born rule.
In this thesis, we characterize {\em fragments} of quantum circuits with nodeterministic semantics.  We give a formal account of nondeterminism using the theory of regular categories and bicategories of relations. We show that certain categories of relations can be regarded as quantum circuits by looing at the  finite dimensional Hilbert spaces square integrable functions on these spaces.

The first fragment which analyze in Chapter \ref{chap:zxa} is that generated by the Toffoli gate as well as state preparation and post selection in the $Z$ and $X$ basis.  We give a complete presentation of this category and  show how it arizes in terms of a full subcategory of spans of finite sets.  By imposing a single additional equation, we obtain a relational countrerpart with proper nondeterministic semantics

In Chapter \ref{chap:dist}  we decompose the axioms the presentation of the previous chapter using distributive laws.  We exhibit substructural features of this model and discuss the relation to partiality and reversibility.


Finally in Chapter \ref{chap:stab}  we give a relational account of the prop of mixed stabilizer circuits of odd prime dimensions in terms of affine coisotropic relations over finite fields.  

%
%There is a conceptual advantage to modelling these fragments in terms of categories of spans or relations:  this perspective illuminates some of the most elegant symmetries of the ZX and ZH.
%
%For example, \dag-Frobenius algebras in $\FHilb$, which are used to express orthonormal bases are shown to arise from a colimit in such a fragment.  Moreover, the Euler decomposition of the Fourier transform is shown to arise from the hopf law.
%
%The CPM construction, which is traditionally used to model density matrices using monoidal categories, also surprisingly plays various roles in our presentations of these fragments of quantum circuits.  Not only does it allow one to mix, quantum circuits, a very closely related construction adds the plus state to partial, reversible boolean circuits.  Perhaps more surprisingly, the CPM construction also captures the notion of the Fourier transform, and Euler decomposition; when it is applied to phase-free circuits: ie, circuits which correspond to linear subspaces of $\F_p$-vector spaces.
%
%Finally, we conclude the thesis by regarding {\em quantum protocols themselves} as a generalized category of relations.  The machinery involved in this case is the 2-category of profunctors: which can be thought of as bimodules of categories.  This gives a structural account of the scalable ZX-calculus, which is used to parametrize families of circuits using string diagrams.  In particular, this is a limit over profunctors: an instance of the so called Benabou-Grothendieck construction.  Because of the generality at which this is proven, we suggest applications in other domains where string diagrams are used.
