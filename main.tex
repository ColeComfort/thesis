\begin{acknowledgements}

I would have not been able to write this thesis without the help and support of many people, both academics and nonacademics;  especially due to the circumstances in the University of  Oxford Department of Computer Science following the pandemic.

First, I thank my fellow students and postdocs in the quantum group at  Oxford for their good company and research discussions: especially Alex,  Amin, Antonin, James, John, Lia, Lukas, Matt, all three Nicks, Nihil, Sivert, Razin, Tein and Will.  Also I can't forget Sander, who was a postdoc the year before when I visited during my masters degree.
I am also thankful to Aleks for his advice and help in writing our paper as well as Bob for getting me funding and all the  food and drink.
I also am thankful to Pawe\l{} and the TallCat group in Estonia for welcoming me as a guest when I was at that time unwelcome in my own department.  I also would like to thank the Programming Principles, Logic and Verification Group at UCL for allowing me to visit; especially Leo and Robin for fruitful discussions and Wojtek for his very welcoming company. I would also like to thank the group at Pisa for letting me visit; especially Alessandro and Filippo for discussions about research and Fabio for the good food and wine. I would also like to thank everyone at the Mathematically Structured Programming group in Glasgow as well as both Roberts in Edinburgh.
I am also grateful to the Canadian category theory community, especially Amolak, Ben, Jon, Jeff and Robin.  I am especially grateful to JS for his sage advice, encouragement and kindness; without which, I probably would have never done a PhD.  Also thanks to all of my friends who regularly attend ACT and QPL, and the other category theorists who I bump into ever so often.

Finally, I am also grateful to my family and all my friends in Canada, Tallinn and Oxford who have not influenced my research but have made doing a PhD more tolerable.

\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we exhibit nondeterministic semantics for fragments of quantum circuits using  categories of spans and relations.  First, we show that the class of circuits generated by the  Toffoli gate as well the states $|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$, $\sqrt{2}|+\rangle$ and their adjoints is characterized in terms of spans of finite sets/matrices over the natural numbers.  We also give a complete axiomatization for these circuits.  With this semantics in mind, we discuss the connection to partial and reversible computation. We also exhibit an isomorphism between the prop of affine coisotropic relations over odd prime fields and odd-prime-dimensional mixed stabilizer circuits.  We show how this can be constructed by doubling the phase-free ZX-calculus twice, iterating the CPM construction.  We discuss the relation of this semantics for stabilizer circuits to  previously known semantics for idealized classes of electrical circuits.     Finally, we attempt to give a categorical semantics for proof nets for monoidal categories/the scalable ZX-calculus using profunctors which are a categorification of relations.
