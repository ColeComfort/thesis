\begin{abstract}
In this thesis we exhibit nondeterministic semantics for fragments of quantum circuits using  categories of spans and relations.  First, we show that the class of circuits generated by Toffoli gates as well as state preparation and postselection in the $Z$ and $X$-bases is characterized in terms of spans of finite sets/matrices over the natural numbers, and give a complete presentation thereof. With this semantics in mind, we discuss the connection to partial and reversible computation. We also exhibit an isomorphism between the prop of affine coisotropic relations over odd prime fields and odd-prime-dimensional mixed stabilizer circuits; we show how this can be constructed by doubling the phase-free ZX-calculus twice, iterating the CPM construction.   We show how this is closely related to previously known semantics for idealized classes of electrical circuits.     Finally, we attempt to give a categorical semantics for proof nets for monoidal the scalable ZX-calculus using profunctors which are a categorification relations.

Chapter \ref{chap:background} is a literature review.  Chapter \ref{chap:zxa} contains work written solely by the author of this thesis with Sections \ref{sec:cpm}-\ref{sec:ZXA} of Chapter \ref{chap:zxa} being adapted from conference proceedings \cite{zxa}.  Chapter \ref{chap:stab} contains work jointly coauthored with my supervisor Aleks Kissinger, published in conference proceedings \cite{lagrel}.  The final part of Chapter  \ref{chap:stab} after and including Section \ref{sec:coisotrel} as well Chapter \ref{chap:grothendieck} contains work solely by the author of this thesis.
